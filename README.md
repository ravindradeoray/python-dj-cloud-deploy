# Python Django app 

 App created following tutorial page at djangoprojects.com. Ready to run locally and for additional changes to support cloud deployments. I will be using this app for AWS EB (elasticbeanstalk) demo.

 ## Running app locally
> Recommended to setup a virtual environment with python 3.9.x

- `cd python-dj-cloud-deploy`
- activate python virtual env
- `pip install -r  requirements.txt`
- setup env variable `export DEBUG=1` to activate local mode
- `python manage.py migrate` 
- `python manage.py loaddata polls`
- optonal `python manage.py createsuperuser`
- `python manage.py runserver`
- validate - http://127.0.0.1:8080/polls/

 ## Running app on AWS EB

### pre-requisites
- have a working aw accont
- for easy start, we will keep default vpc with all public subnets. In part 2 we will deal with network customization 
- install aws cli, aws eb cli
- setup account for cli, ensure you account has all necessary permissions. Start with non console admin role. 

### Application changes to support AWS and local
-- drive configuration using environment variables
Add env variable DEBUG=1 which will force application to run with Debug mode
if debug is not set of is set to anything other than '1' will be considered as production mode



### steps/commands to launch aws envrionment
