# Python Django app 

 App created following tutorial page at djangoprojects.com. Ready to run locally and for additional changes to support cloud deployments. I will be using this app for AWS EB (elasticbeanstalk) demo.

 ## Running app locally
> Recommended to setup a virtual environment with python 3.9.x

- `cd python-dj-cloud-deploy`
- activate python virtual env
- `pip install -r  requirements.txt`
- `python manage.py migrate` 
- `python manage.py runserver`
